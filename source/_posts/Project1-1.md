## Project"+1"

### 2020.10.23

**My project, "The Glass", is \"+1\" with the theme of Alice in
Wonderland. From the perspective of a dream, Alice in Wonderland
metaphorically describes the mapping relationship between dream and
reality. Everyone is saying deranged words, expressing the most real
feelings in the heart. It\'s a chessboard with no pieces. You play
yourself and you play against yourself, and the field of battle is
determined by where you place yourself. You can, like a child, abandon
your knowledge of the world and fantasize about a battle that does not
exist. When you conquer yourself, I believe, everyone will have their
own answers. Discard cognition, discard maturity. It\'s more like a
propositional daydream. Find yourself relaxing and daydreaming. This is
just my favorite absurd romance in simple life.**

**W**hen I finally finished this project, it was actually early morning.
I\'m actually a little confused, and this is kind of the state I was
thinking of, saying weird things, doing crazy things. This is a
seemingly simple, absurd and meaningless work. In fact, I probably knew
it when I spent a few days perfecting it. I\'ve been wrapped up in my
own theory. In fact, The reason I chose this theme is because a friend
who doesn\'t remember me said that \"crows are like writing desks\".
There was no reason for absurdity, but she often said it. I don\'t know
if I sympathize with her mental illness or I yearn for the ability to
think about the reality of insanity. So I did this project, which was
boring, outrageous or pointless. But it makes sense to me, to
commemorate someone who probably won\'t remember me, as a place of pain
and stress. Or as a tool for me to communicate with her in the past.
Thank you for seeing this. It\'s probably embarrassing to wake up the
next day and see these words.

When I decided that \"the Glass\" was the best strategy, I realized that
the finished product would be clunky and unsuitable. So I had a lot of
psychological struggle after the idea or throw away. Especially the rose
I really like. I began to simplify my work design. The original design
of four poker patterns folded into a rose was abandoned, I think the
board is enough to connect people to it. Due to time and material
limitations, I can only make a sample from recycled materials. In the
original idea, this should be a complete wooden frame made of glass in
the middle, in which the black part of the sample is the frosted texture
of glass. This design indirectly replaces the white room in my
imagination with all the background of life. Everyone can be their own
character or create their own character. At the same time, I pursue my
standards for what I think are the best materials.

While board and playing CARDS are
relatively well-regulated objects, dreams are a reality full of the
subconscious. How to throw away the existing rational rules and make the
board an unconscious result, I tried to solve the paradoxical logic: how
to define a thing with logic that has no logic, because it has no logic,
it is a very interesting process. I once had a favorite singer who said:
if I make a song with the theme of \"nothing\", an empty audio or
nothing could not be fully reflected, because I could not assume that
the theme does not exist, because its existence has become a fact. But
since the root of dreams is the subconscious, there is ultimately a
rational, so called subconscious, which mirrors reality in chaos. Every
character in Alice\'s Wonderland is a bit of a lunatic, whether it\'s
the march Hare with a hormonal disorder or the Mad Hatter with mercury
poisoning. And this crazy or absurd statement is the true expression of
one\'s inner desire. The chessboard can act as a given reality, turning
the pieces into the embodiment of a person\'s dream or subconscious
mind. When I want to draw a checkerboard in a city, it may not be
realistic, and the objects in the city may limit one\'s imagination or
as a connection to reality. So I rethought the problem a little bit, and
maybe I could draw the checkerboard on the glasses. In a closed, pure
white room, each person is given glasses with a grid pattern, and each
person can arrange his or her own checkerboard. It is more about letting
people make their own chess board or thinking. This may not be a
competitive chess game, but the meaning is to let people be happy in the
subconscious, and at the same time to give subconscious boundaries, just
like dreams have the basis of reality or experience.

I rethought the concept of story, and I was always confused about what I
could do. I like this absurd but romantic feeling. I had several ideas
at first. The first idea was to make a die. When I finished the drawing,
I found that all of these seemed not to be a project that could be
completed in a short period of time, so I put it into the following
extension category.

The reason why I choose chess is mainly because it is rich in
traditional sense of romance. A stodgy board game that, as said, has a
historical feel to it, as stated in the introduction at the beginning.
At the same time, chess and CARDS are also important elements in the
whole story. When I looked it up, I was poked at this point.

Word games are so-called nonsense words
that are connected by grammatical sounds or allusions。So I want to find
a ridiculous node, so that people can participate in the irrational
process in this environment. Every word should be subconscious, not
conscious. So I thought why not make an empty chessboard and let
everyone have a dream with a deck of CARDS. Because dreams are like a
bridge linking the reality and the subconscious, which reflects the
reality. Irrational words are actually the most authentic embodiment of
the human heart, and a return to the reality.

### 2020.10.8

[First tutoria]{.ul}l:

Find the link: AW & project/AW & interests

The weird and the Eerie(book)

To consider: Horror toy

Scary object in house

Animism

Pierre Huyghe-Human Mask

Creation own fiction for the object

Cheshire Cat

Fear can be controlled by one\'s mood or state of mind at the moment. So
there\'s no real definition of fear, and anything that goes against the
idea of the moment can be said to be a reversal or something that pops
up all of a sudden can be identified as an element of terror. So terror
should not be routinely added, or even customized, in a sense.

Another interesting point is that when I looked at Pierre Huyghe\'s
HUMAN MASK^xviii^ it wasn\'t immediately clear to me that it was
actually a macaque rather than a man, and I know a few close-up shots of
the ball of his foot. So the mask is a direct bridge into a character,
it connects two different objects, I am full of surrealist ideas.

### 2020.10.7

[A discussion brief]{.ul}: historical =historical authenticity. (In a
philosophical sense)

Which is finding the historical root of things or ideas or their
development along the way of one thing or sorts of objects.

[The choice of collection]{.ul}: After browsing many exhibits, I decided
to find a series of products belonging to the extension of \"Alice in
Wonderland\" in the Victoria and Albert Museum^i^ (V&A Museum). These
products recreate the wonderful elements of the original \"Alice in
Wonderland\" book.

[First idea]{.ul}: Make a horror toy. It\'s an adult-oriented toy with a
slightly creepy image feature on the content. When a non-human object
approaches the face of a human in an extremely infinite way, the sense
of terror will be extremely elevated. However, if the cognition of the
object has not reached a certain level, there is no way to reach the
sense of horror. At the same time, Alice\'s Wonderland is similar to an
adult fairy tale. Although it is dark and absurd, its romantic essence
should not be changed. I hope that the elements of animals, insects or
plants that already exist in nature can be adopted. Traditional elements
of the game should also be included: poker or chess.
